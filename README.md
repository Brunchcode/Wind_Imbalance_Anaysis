# Wind_Imbalance_Anaysis
wind imbalance excercise for Power Marlet Analyst Interview


Included in this workbook are forecast and outturn generation volumes for 6 windfarms which, together, make up a fictional wind fleet.

They are loosely based on real windfarms, although some adjustments have been made.
The half hourly imbalance costs are fictional.

The imbalance cost is the difference between the actual and the forecast generation volume multiplied the imbalance cost. 
Imbalance cost per MWh is the total imbalance cost divided by total metered output.

data is included for each half hour settlement period from 1st April 2020 to 31st  March 2024 (4 financial years).

Task:
Please complete the analysis detailed below and prepare a short presentation on the analysis.
Come to the interview prepared to discuss in detail the analysis you have carried out.


Analysis:
Using Python (or any other analysis tool) carry out the following analysis of the data:

1) Carry out a data validation process. be prepared to explain/show your data validation process and  how you managed incomplete/inconsistent data

2) calculate the average imbalance cost over the complete timeframe for each windfarm (1-9) as well as for the fleet as a whole. Express this cost in Â£/MWh of generation volume.
     -  Do imbalance costs vary year to year?

3) how do the individual site imbalance costs compare to fleet average?



Presentation:
Please prepare to give a short (5-10 minutes) presentation which will include:

- Overview of any issues you found with the data and how you managed these in order to carry out analysis
 - How you modelled the imbalance cost (tools used, modelling approach etc.)
- Short Summary of wind imbalance cost calculated on a site specific basis
- Any other insights gleaned from the data that could be used to inform an imbalance forecast (optional)

You are welcome to include slides as part of your presentation, but please keep these to no more than 2-3.
